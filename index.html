    <h2> Whats Planned for Next Year</h2>
    <p1>The 2016 Summer Language Institute in Italy will be led once again by our exceptional lecturer in Italian language and culture, Prof. Iva Youkilis. Prof. Youkilis holds an M.A. in Italian from the University of Virginia. She has extensive experience in language teaching and has led our Institute since 2005.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1>You will have the option to enroll in one of the following language courses:</p1>
      <h2> </h2>
    <li> Italian 1017, Elementary Italian. This is a beginning language course stressing rapid acquisition of spoken ability with some attention to the development of reading, writing, and listening skills as well. It is designed for students with no prior knowledge of Italian or minimal experience in another Romance language. 3 units. </p>
    <p1> Or</p1>
    <h2> </h2>
    <p1> Italian 308, Grammar and Composition II. A continuation of Italian 307D, this course features advanced lessons in Italian syntax and vocabulary and an introduction to the analysis of poetry and theatrical texts, with the goal of improving both reading and writing in Italian. The basis of our work will be a series of readings having a common theme, desire requited and unrequited. We will think about what poets desire, how they give verbal expression to it, and how the success or failure of their pursuit informs their writing. Likewise, we will look at how playwrights exploit this theme as a plot device. Readings include poetry by Petrarch, Michelangelo, Tasso, and Montale, as well as two comedies. 3 units.</p>
    <h2> </h2>
    <li>Italian 2017, Level III. This is our third-semester course, open to students who will have completed Italian 102 and/or 107 before or in Spring 2015. The course offers an extensive review of basic grammar structures as well as a guided introduction to reading, and lessons in contemporary Italian culture. 3 units.</p1>
    <p1> and you will also enroll in</p1>
    <h2> </h2>
    <li> Italian 319, Conversation class. This course examines popular culture through a focus on what is said and performed. The course consists of thematic units focusing on everyday occurrences and themes that mark the Italian experience, such as conversation in the Italian bar; poignant views of life expressed in films and other media; daily experiences depicted in poems and songs; public and private politics; the role of the meal in real life, art, and literature. As students advance through each thematic module, they develop a creative project in which they put into practice (by a skit/presentation/text/artwork) what they have learned. You will have the opportunity to confer, in Italian, with a local expert in the subject you have chosen, for your oral presentation, which you will deliver (very capably) at the end of the Institute in Italian! One certain source of cultural inspiration in the past three years was the 2-day course led by Prof. William Wallace, Barbara Murphy Bryant Distinguished Professor of Art History at Washington University. Prof. Wallace conducted walking tours of some of the greatest cities of the Italian Middle Ages and Renaissance. A highlight of the trip! Check for the surprise itinerary for the next summer!</p1>
    <h2> </h2>
    <p1> All students at the Institute will take one of the three language courses plus Italian 319, receiving a total of six units of credit for their five-week course of study.</p1>
    <h2> What are the Dates?</h2>
    <p1> The Institute begins following the spring semester and final exams. The 2016 Summer program will begin on May 17 and end on June 20. This schedule offers several advantages:</p1>
    <li> The early departure date enables you to fly at lower fares, thereby keeping your travel costs to a minimum.</li>
    <li>Since the Institute ends in June, you will still have about two months left in which to return home to a job, or to travel around Europe. You can also get back in time for the Summer school. </li>
    <li>The pleasant weather and fewer tourists make this the ideal time to be abroad. </li>
    <h2> Where would I be?</h2>
    <p1>The Institute travel to Florence, Rome, and the lodging at Villa Casabianca is located in Castelraimondo, a small but lively city in the hills of Marche. This beautiful region of east-central Italy is situated alongside Tuscany and Umbria. Pronounced "lay markay," the name is sometimes translated into English as "The Marches," and it comes from the Frankish word for “frontier.” Tucked between the Adriatic Sea and the high Apennine mountains, much of it remains unspoiled by the ravages of mass tourism. While the Adriatic coast has been a mecca for "sun ’n sand" tourism for centuries, perhaps more so than anywhere else in central Italy, you will find places where time really has stood still. Vast stretches of green hillsides accented with native trees and flowers, centuries-old town and villas will greet you as you travel, providing breathtaking photo-ops and indelible memories.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1>The history of Le Marche stretches back to Paleolithic times. The Piceni tribes ruled the area starting in the 4th century BC, and were later absorbed by the growing power of Rome. The Franks later conquered the area in the name of the Church. Le Marche then served as the boundary between Papal and Imperial lands, until Napoleon defeated the Papal army in 1860. Le Marche was absorbed into the new nation of Italy shortly thereafter in November of 1861.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p2>The region is famous throughout Italy and the rest of Europe as a leader in the paper, furniture and leather industries and in clothing manufacture, as well as in excellent wine and cuisine, including black truffles, river trout and wild boar. Le Marche is renowned for its many medieval festivals, held throughout the region, and in the beginning of June there is a spectacular event, the Infiorata del Corpus Domini, in our town of Castelraimondo. Castelraimondo also boasts some of the best gelaterie, or ice cream parlors, and its pizzerie never disappoint. Students can thus observe and participate in the Italian lifestyle at its enjoyable best. The cordial citizens of Castelraimondo help make this an ideal city in which to live.</p2>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1>You will of course want to travel elsewhere in Italy during your stay in Castelraimondo, and your schedule will allow you two trips in addition to our planned weekend excursion to Siena, Cinque Terre, Padova, Bologna, Venezia, Napoli, Capri, Pompei, just to mention some. Our weekend begins on Thursday after lunch, at which time you (and the group) are free to leave town for a few days but we must be back together in time for late Sunday afternoon classes. Free days may vary.</p1>
    <h2> Where would I stay in Castelraimondo?</h2>
    <p1>Students are housed in the Villa Casabianca, in Castelraimondo. The construction date of the villa is uncertain but its history goes back to 1573 when it belonged to an ancient organization of the Vatican State which owned the property for approximately three centuries. Today the renovated villa is a truly modern facility which offers comfortable, sunny rooms with sufficient closet space, spotless bathrooms, an outdoor swimming pool, indoor gym, plenty of green space, and beautiful views of the surrounding snow-capped mountains. Best of all, the villa boasts an excellent location: quietly situated on the edge of town, it allows easy access to the city on foot or by shuttle. In past years we've enjoyed the privacy of the second floor which we share with no one. Rooms accommodate from two to six people.</p1>
    <h2> Something different for the end...Croatia!<h2/>
    <p1> We will spend the last week in Croatia!  We will cross the Adriatic and make our way to the north of Croatia, to Istria, a  small peninsula a few hours' drive from Venice.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1>In Istria County, local government services are provided in Croatian and Italian. Croatia and Switzerland are today the only two places outside of Italy where Italian is an official language. There are Italian-language kindergartens and schools, and population can choose which one to attend. The newspaper La Voce del Popolo, is published daily in Rijeka/Fiume.</p1>
    <h2> </h2>
    <p1> Road signs and town names throughout the region appear in Croatian and Italian. Everyone speaks Italian, but what Croatians can do with accent marks — so many accent marks on Cs and Zs, and Ss — is remarkable. And for a little trivia, the towns whose names end in "-an" and "-ana" were founded by former soldiers of the Roman Empire, who were promised land in exchange for service. You'll see Roman touches throughout the quiet and sleepy towns — from the architectural arches to the paintings of lions in coliseums in old churches. Of the dozens of amphitheaters left around Europe and North Africa by Roman engineers, Pula’s is the sixth largest, and one of the best preserved anywhere.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1>And though the Italian influence is strong, historically speaking, modern Italy is but a speck in the timeline of Istria, a land that's seen more than its share of action and invasions. The Illyrians settled in the Bronze Age, followed by the Romans, then the Byzantines, the Croats, the Slovenes, the Franks, the Venetians — and this overview only takes us up to the late 1700s. That's a lot of people for not a lot of land, but no one has ever been able to resist the appeal of hill towns, forests, and beaches within an hour's easy drive.</p1>
    <h2> Where and what would I eat?</h2>
    <p1> Meals take place in the dining hall at the villa. Meals always provide a warm and informal setting in which to discuss our weekend plans, our classes, and our experiences. The food is plentiful and carefully prepared.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <li> Breakfast: tea or caffellatte, slices of Tuscan bread with butter and jelly, home-made cakes, biscotti and many delicious creations with Nutella.</li>
    <li>Lunch and dinner are similar: pasta, risotto, soup, polenta-proteins in many forms and shapes (meat, fish, omelettes, cheese), plus salad or vegetables (sliced tomatoes with fresh basil are always a hit) and fruit, if you have room for it.</li>
    <h2> What would my day be like?</h2>
    <p1> The day begins with breakfast, followed by the grammar lesson. After a break, we spend an hour in conversation section. After lunch you are free for the rest of the afternoon. You may choose to spend the afternoon shopping or wandering through town, or you may go to smaller towns in the region, or simply relax in the sun. Whatever you do, you must return to the Villa for dinner. Naturally, you will also have to set some time aside to study. Students often study together and help one another master the material.</p1>
    <h2> How much contact would I have with Italians? </h2>
    <p1> Lots! Classes are held in the morning, and the rest of the time students are encouraged to venture out on their own. Among other reasons, we picked Castelraimondo for the Institute because the city is not frequented by tourists, so when you’re in town you’ll be meeting Italians and talking to them in Italian. Your travels as well will bring you into frequent contact with Italians.</p1>
    <h2> Will there be room for trips?</h2>
    <p1>Ma certo! In addition to our constantly moving program you will have the chance to travel to many places close by our locations. The June weather is perfect for a trip to the beach, and evenings at the disco (after studying for your final exam, of course) will help you burn off some of your gelato calories.</p1>
    <h2> Amazing! How much does it all cost?</h2>
    <p1>The cost for the 2016 program is $6100 and will include:</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <li> Room and partial board</li>
    <li>Tuition for six credits </li>
    <li>All expenses for relocating from one city to other, including trains, hotels, breakfast, lunch and dinner while studying (meals during free weekends excluded) </li>
